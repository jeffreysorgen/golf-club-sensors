# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello Git Community!

I am Jeff, new here. But __*not*__ new to tech and coding. Python predominantly, and beginning with TinyML and Arduino so far, so cpp is also going to be in the mix.

## Documenting my activity:

My process:

1. **Git** Practicing with Repositories, Branches, Commits, Pull Requests, and Merges with [help from this Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
2. **Markdown** Learned to use [Markdown from this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
3. **TinyML** Took course for TinyML from EdX (complete)

Next steps:
* Upon completion of EdX course, review the material and do all assignments again
* Create **Wiki** showing Accomplishments
  * Took Class
  * Bought book
  * Document assignments or examples
* Create new repository "hello-world-arduino"
* Document all assignments here in the documentation
