# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello Git Community!
I am Jeff - new to Git, but __*not*__ new to tech and coding. I've used Python predominantly, but I'm beginning with TinyML and Arduino, so C++ is also going to be in the mix very soon.

*This hello-world repository was created to learn Git and store my progress and ideas.*

**Files:**
- My activity is documented in [activity.md](activity.md)
- My golf swing idea is documented in [golf-swing-idea.md](golf-swing-idea.md)





### Learning about this right now:
KiCad, OSHPARK, GitHub, probably GitBASH

#
*All I'm doing right now is working with the hello-world readme.md file to practice using Git. After building confidence just with the MD file, I'll start working with CODE*
