# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello Git Community!

I am Jeff, new here. But __*not*__ new to tech and coding. Python predominantly, and beginning with TinyML and Arduino so far, so cpp is also going to be in the mix.

## Documenting my activity:

My process:

1. **Markdown** Learned to use [Markdown from this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. **TinyML** Took course for TinyML from EdX (complete)

Next steps:
1. Upon completion, review the course a second time and do all assignments again
1. Decide whether these kinds of notes need to be in a **Wiki** instead
1. Create new repository "hello-world-arduino"
1. Document all assignments here in the documentation
