Hello Git Community!

I am Jeff, new here. But not new to tech and coding. Python predominantly, and beginning with TinyML and Arduino so far, so cpp is also going to be in the mix.

Documenting my activity:

My process:

First, learn how to use Markdown in this README

Take course for TinyML from EdX (complete)

Upon completion, review the course a second time and do all assignments again

Document all assignments here in the documentation
