# Golf Swing Helper
This repository consists of code and any related descriptive narrative about the implementation of my Golf Swing Helper project. I'm developing this on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, employing TinyML (tfmicro) for inference when needed, and BLE (Bluetooth low energy) for communication between the Nano and a smartphone.
## Background
As an amateur golfer, it's important to get real-time feedback on the condition of my golf swing. I need a way to instantly know whether I am swinging my club correctly prior to hitting the ball, or if I've got it right. For me, the psychology of approaching the ball goes in two directions. One, I am confident and relaxed, or two, my mind is racing and I need to quiet it down.  
###
What primarily causes me to think too much? I've just flubbed the last shot and I'm trying to get over it. I need to eliminate 100% of the flubs in my game. I would rather concentrate on my aim and club selection decisions, rather than on the goofy swing I am trying to avoid.
###
Imagine approaching your ball with your club in hand, and taking a few practice swings. In your head, a lot of things are going on based on what you've heard recently from your coach, maybe have seen in coaching videos, or what you heard moments ago from your excellent golf partner.
###
If you're like me trying to remember what you saw on YouTube, then it's hard to recall the information in a way that's helpful at the very moment you step up to the ball. And your game will be long over when you finally get back to studying how well you did by reflecting on your score, as you search for new answers from your favorite sources.
###
This project is going to help me with my swing by providing instant feedback when my practice swing is not where it needs to be. I'll instantly know the difference between a good swing and a bad one. 
- With a good swing I'll hear a positive chirp from my smartphone, which I keep in my golf cart. 
- With a not-so-good swing, I'll hear a sad chirp from my Golf Swing Helper.
