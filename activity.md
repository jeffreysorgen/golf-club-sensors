# Documenting my activity:
## Learning about this:
KiCad, LTspice, OSHPARK, GitHub, probably GitBASH
## Completed:
1. **Git** Practicing with Repositories, Branches, Commits, Pull Requests, and Merges with [help from this Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
2. **Markdown** Learned to use [Markdown from this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
3. **TinyML** Took course for TinyML from EdX (complete)
4. [**activity.md**](activity.md) (This) Describes my next steps, ideas, and this Completed list
5. [**golf-swing-idea.md**](golf-swing-idea.md) Defines the parts of my golf swing idea (ongoing)
6. **GitHub Pages** Added using [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) and is accessible [here](https://jeffreysorgen.github.io/hello-world/) (ongoing)
7. Changed hello-world (this) repository to **PRIVATE**, so it isn't publicly available now on GitHub Pages either
8. Installed **GitHub Desktop**, added ArduinoBLE-to-Android repository via Desktop




## Next steps:
Step one of [Golf Swing](golf-swing-idea.md) project is BLE
- What are the next steps?
  - watch video
  - implement BLE
  - copy the code I use into the repo



#
#### Future next steps:
* Repeat EdX course material, do all TinyML assignments again
  - Include Jupyter Notebooks, Python, C++ (the h files, c files and others)
  - **Fully utilize GitHub features and functionality**




###
* Create new repository "hello-world-arduino" for book exercise (sine function)
* Determine whether to use GitHub Desktop and/or BASH
* Continue recording progress in THIS page
  - Accomplishments or Highlights likely to be ANOTHER page
  - What are GISTS ?
* Jot down ideas for other projects here
  * wind turbine ( Is the most popular product TinyML or IoT? )
  * Continue to flesh out golf swing idea, [_here_](golf-swing-idea.md)
* Prototyping with KiCad, OSHPARK, and more
* Determine whether to keep the TEST site called _jdsgithubpages_
* Determine whether my **GitHub Page** should be redirected to here from **tech**.jeffreysorgen.com 
* Determine physical nature of MCU board form factor and its protection from damage
* Determine whether learning SmartPhone App Development is necessary
* Not Needed: GIF of photos of certs, book, Arduino board, etc (not yet)
* Not Needed: **Wiki**
