## Documenting my activity:

Completed:

1. **Git** Practicing with Repositories, Branches, Commits, Pull Requests, and Merges with [help from this Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
2. **Markdown** Learned to use [Markdown from this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
3. **TinyML** Took course for TinyML from EdX (complete)
4. This **activity.md** describes my next steps and ideas as well as what's in this Completed list
5. This README defines the parts of my [golf swing idea](https://github.com/jeffreysorgen/hello-world/blob/main/README.md#golf-swing-idea) (ongoing)

Next steps:
* Create **GitHub Pages** with [**this** guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
  - LEARN about this (doing this now)
* Include in GitHubPages: Progress, Accomplishments, Highlights and Features
* Upon completion of EdX course, review the material and do all assignments again
  - Include Jupyter Notebooks, Python, C++ (the h files and others)
  - **Fully utilize GitHub features and functionality**
* Add Accomplishments to GitHub Pages
  * Took Class
  * Bought book
  * Document assignments or examples
  * Include photos of certs, book, Arduino board
    * make GIF of these
* Determine whether my **GitHub Page** should be redirected to here from **tech**.jeffreysorgen.com 
* Create new repository "hello-world-arduino" for book exercise (sine function)
* Jot down ideas for other projects here
  * wind turbine ( Is the most popular product TinyML or IoT? )
  * Continue to flesh out golf swing idea, _below_
* Prototyping with KiCad, OSHPARK, and more
* Determine physical nature of MCU board form factor and its protection from damage
* Determine whether learning SmartPhone App Development is necessary
* Not Needed: **Wiki**
